# PRODIGY_GA_03_TextGenertation_MarkovChains
This code builds a Markov chain from Ali Wong's text and generates random sentences. It reads the text, creates a dictionary mapping each word to possible following words, and then uses this dictionary to randomly construct sentences. The generated sentences mimic the structure and flow of the original text.
